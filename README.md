# ScalaFiddle editor

This project provides an [online editor](https://scalafiddle.io) for creating, sharing and embedding Scala fiddles (little Scala programs that can run in your
browser).

## Usage

For documentation on how to use the ScalaFiddle editor, see the [Welcome](docs/Welcome-src.md).

## Hosting your own ScalaFiddle editor

ScalaFiddle has been designed to be easy to host on your own. It's published as Docker images (`scalafiddle/scalafiddle-editor`,
`scalafiddle/scalafiddle-router` and `scalafiddle/scalafiddle-core`) which provide an easy way to set up your own service.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the ScalaFiddle project, for example to add a new library dependency, read the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) 
for more instructions on how to set up a local dev env for ScalaFiddle editor and core.
